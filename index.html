    <h2>What is Measuremate?</h2>

        Measuremate is a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox, which appears on the toolbar (besides the search bar) if
        you allow it to show there. You just have to click on the icon and the extension will appear. You just have to
        type in 1 input and all the others will be automatically converted. The conversions are not rounded for exact
        precision as allowed by the web language javascript. The UI is friendly and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        The extension is currently on v1.5 and a feature you have never seen in other convertors is that the feet and
        inches are separate inputs but act as one. Suppose you want to convert your height from feet and inches to
        meters, other convertors will ask it in decimals, whereas, Measuremate has separate feet and inches so you don't
        have to go to another calculator app and convert feet and inches to decimal feet. The extension makes it easy
        for people to convert with exact precision.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
        Measuremate is currently only available for desktop Firefox Mozilla and is open-source. It requires the
        permission to access your data for all websites. It does not break any privacy code, and this permission is the
        main reason the extension is source code, so people can always check what the extension is actually doing. There
        is no hidden code, all is right in front of you.

    <div class="section-content">

      <p>If you didn't already read above, Measuremate first of all, offers separate feet and inches input, convenient for many people as nobody wants to get their height in decimal feet, right? It also doesn't only support Length units, if you scroll down a bit, you will see almost all of the units used to measure mass or weight, whatever you call it.</p>

      <p>All the units are precisely converted so you can easily get the exact conversion, instead of rounded of figures in other convertors. All the units are changeable, meaning you can type in any input, and all the same type units will be converted. You just need to type, as simple as that.</p>

      <p>The extension is fully free to use and up to date. It is fully open-source and you can report any bugs and leave any reviews you want. If you experience any bug, report it at the <a href="https://github.com/chill31/measuremate/issues">github repository</a> and it will be soon fixed.</p>
